title: About

I have a friend with whom I once went to a party. As there were other people we were going with, we sat on the front of bus front and discussed. After an unknown amount of time, we realized the others were gone. It all happened because we were talking about Philip Wadler and his work.

We enjoy having such discussions so we decided to create a place where we'll have them. We study Computer Science, enjoy mathematics and philosophy.
